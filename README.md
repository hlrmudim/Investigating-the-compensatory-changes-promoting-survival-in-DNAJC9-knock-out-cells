**Introduction:**

DNAJC9 is a heat shock chaperone and histone-binding protein involved in protein folding and chromatin organization.
It has emerging links to cancer, but its precise role in tumour biology is still unclear.
We analyzed the impact of DNAJC9 knockout using GO enrichment, protein interaction networks, and comparisons to published datasets (Hammond et al., 2021; Balachandra et al., 2024).
Results suggest disruption of cancer-related pathways, supporting the need for further investigation into DNAJC9â€™s therapeutic potential

**Aim:**

To investigate the functional role of DNAJC9 in cancer-related biological processes by analyzing the molecular consequences of DNAJC9 knockout (KO) compared to wild-type (WT) cells.

**Objective:**

Perform functional annotation and GO enrichment analysis.
Identify key biological processes and molecular functions.
Construct protein-protein interaction networks.
Use InteractiveVenn .
Compare findings to published datasets.

**Materials and Methods:**
